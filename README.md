This is the backup of my shell configurations under ~/ on the csl-227-99 machine.
This repo is itself a folder under ~/, with files hard-linked from actual configs under ~/. In this way, all shell config changes will be automatically reflected in this repo, and could be conveniently committed.
To use it, either 1) clone this repo and create hard-links under ~/, or 2) copy the config files to ~/
